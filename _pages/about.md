Current
===

*I am eager to explore advanced machine learning methodologies and apply them to interdisciplinary research at the intersection of computational social science, entrepreneurship studies, and sociology. My research interests include machine learning, natural language processing, social network analysis, and the development of equitable and data-driven frameworks for addressing societal challenges.*
