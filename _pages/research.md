## 1. AI + Metaverse Value Creator

*Summer Research Program at HKU*

Supervisor: Prof. [Adela S.M. Lau]([https://dsxt.ustc.edu.cn/zj_ywjs.asp?zzid=860](https://dblp.org/pid/98/6322.html))

June 2023 --- Aug. 2023, HKU

* Developed innovative marketing strategies utilizing augmented reality and 3D modeling, optimizing user engagement and satisfaction. Achieved a 30% increase in user engagement and contributed to a $20,000 increase in revenue for pilot metaverse-based services.
* Designed and optimized computer vision algorithms for intelligent monitoring and control of an unmanned football field. Achieved 95% accuracy in identifying key targets such as players and soccer balls and implemented precise target tracking algorithms capable of handling up to 10 moving targets simultaneously in complex dynamic backgrounds.
* Contributed to the design and development of a court automatic control system, enabling automatic switch control of the goal and moving obstacles. Enhanced operational efficiency by 50%, reducing system response time to less than 200 milliseconds.
* Created a virtual reality system to transform 2D image signals into a 3D scene with realistic rendering, achieving high visual recognition accuracy of 97% in real-time. This demonstrated the seamless integration of computer vision with VR technologies.
* Successfully demonstrated a fully functional unmanned soccer field system with a virtual reality environment. The project highlighted practical applications of computer vision and VR technologies in sports and generated three key insights for advancing intelligent sports management and immersive experiences in the metaverse.


## 2. Western Wheat Field School Support Group

*Volunteer teaching in summer*

May 2022 --- Sep. 2022, Gansu province

* Designed and developed a comprehensive computer course curriculum for over 50 students aged 8 to 15, tailored to their varying levels of knowledge. Topics included the use of Windows operating system, PowerPoint creation, Word processing, and an introduction to programming concepts.
* Created and distributed 30+ custom exercises and assignments aligned with the curriculum, achieving a 20% improvement in students' practical skills as measured by pre- and post-program assessments.
* Implemented a project-based teaching approach, encouraging students to apply their learning by completing assigned tasks and exercises. Over 85% of students successfully completed all projects, with some creating independent PowerPoint presentations and basic programs by the end of the program.
* Organized weekly feedback sessions with students and parents, achieving a satisfaction rate of 95%, and provided personalized guidance to help students overcome individual challenges.
